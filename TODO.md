# TODO

Open work, newest first. Tick items off and delete them once done.

## Build plan

The game is built in portions from `docs/spec.md`, one at a time, in this
order. Each portion ends with the game playable, tested (`node --test
tests/` plus a look in the browser) and committed. A portion is planned in
detail when it starts, not before.

No portion is under way: portions 1–10 are done and released in 0.4.0.
0.5.0 and 0.5.1 released the eight levels along the commuter line (BANA
1 Tungelsta, 2 Krigslida, 3 Västerhaninge, 4 Jordbro, 5 Handen, 6
Skogås, 7 Trångsund, 8 Södertörns villastad), each with its own boss,
the ten subcultures, the period scenery, the new facades and the four
new props spread over them; Förorten rests out of the game
(`?bana=forort-1`). The next portion is planned when it starts, from the
open work below; world 2, "The City After Dark" (`docs/spec.md`, section
6), is the next world.

## Balancing

- [ ] Balance the eight levels. The owner has played all of them through
      (2026-11-13) and begun balancing in the level editor; more is
      needed. `node tools/balance.js <id>` gives each level's numbers;
      exports land in `exports/` and are copied into `src/levels/`.

## Features

- [ ] Try the game on an iPhone when one is at hand: upright it should
      say VÄND TELEFONEN, and play once turned by hand (Android was
      tried on a Pixel 8, 2026-11-08).

- [ ] A new level, "Landet" (the countryside), where the red cottages
      now in the suburb's backdrop belong.

## Art

- [ ] The suburb perhaps without the red cottages: lower blocks of
      flats, two or three storeys, in their place (the cottages move to
      "Landet", see Features).
